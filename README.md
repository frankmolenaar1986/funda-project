Project info
==============
This project is meant for an introduction talk with Funda.

Summary
--------------
- I chose php as a language, not because it's my weapon of choice, but simply because i have access to a LAMP installation on my own server to host a demonstration
- There is a bug in the php file (or the API, but im not pointing fingers) that prevents me from querying for more than 25 houses. Yesterday I built a little tool that at least did something similar to the assignment. Tonight I wanted to check if I could fix something but urgent work on different projects prevents me from doing any refactoring right now.
- The php files is commented with the explanations 
- A live demo is located at: http://frankmolenaar.net/funda/project/demo/
